    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",

Utilizing the \"120 years of Olympic history\" dataset, which encapsulates a wide array of metricso of Olympic games including athletes' demographics, event types, and medal outcomes, we aim to identify underlying structures within the data. Data cleaning, EDA, and the application of supervised and unsupervised machine learning model to detect evolution patterns in athlete performance, shifts in sporting disciplines, and emerging trends in country-level competitiveness. By applying these research steps, we intend to come to a conclusion that may offer insights into the dynamics of Olympic sports, potentially guiding strategic decisions in athlete training and preparation, and better knowledge about the countries that produce these athletes. The performance/success of this model and conclusion would be measured by if the cluster results are clear and align with known historical contexts, as well as if it generates interesting unrecognized patterns that might help to shape the policies in future Olympics."

    "\n",
    "In order to solve this problem, we will utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically clustering algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), to group athletes into clusters based on similarities in their profiles and historical performances. We will implement and compare various clustering algorithms to identify groupings most strongly correlated with Olympic medal-winning potential. To evaluate the effectiveness of these groupings, we will adopt a hybrid approach, utilizing both unsupervised and supervised evaluation metrics. For the unsupervised aspect, we will measure the log-likelihood function to assess the model's fit to the data. In the supervised context, even though our primary approach is unsupervised, we will leverage labeled data (medal winners vs. non-winners) to calculate the F1 score and analyze the confusion matrix, providing insight into the precision, recall, and overall accuracy of our clusters in predicting medal-winning athletes. Moreover, this unsupervised learning model is designed for adaptability, allowing it to be reapplied as new athlete data become available or as the focus shifts to different Olympic events. The model's parameters can be adjusted to reflect changes in the sports and Olympic competition formats. This model gives practical insights into the essential qualities of successful Olympians, which can be used to influence future athlete selection and training. It allows sports organizations to more efficiently spend resources by focusing on individuals whose profiles resemble those of previous medal winners. Ultimately, this approach intends to improve Olympic team performance, resulting in a more targeted and effective preparation for the world's premier sporting event."

Considering the historical context of the dataset, where Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year until 1992 and then staggered post-1992, we'll adjust our analysis to accurately reflect this timeline. The primary variables for our analysis will include athletes' physical attributes like age, weight, height, and performance metrics such as number of medals won, and type of sport they participate, national teams they represented. categorical variables like team and event will be encoded using methods suited to the analysis context. Given the vast and diverse nature of the Olympic disciplines, categorizing athletes into their respective sports and events is crucial. However, the direct inclusion of categorical variables such as sport name and event, which can exceed 100 unique values, we would introduce one-hot encoding during the data cleaning process due to the high dimensionality."

    "As mentioned in the problem statement, we are trying to predict the future medal winners based on the medal winning atheletes' characteristics in the previous olympic games, the parameters of characteristics include sex, age, height, weight, event, sport, and team. After initial evaluation on the dataset, we decided to implement GMM to make the prediction. Since based on our dataset, individual athelete belongs to various distributions/clusterings, meaning we have to implement an algorithm that takes this into consideration, as we know GMM is best for dataset that has underlying distributions and clusters that are aberrant, in addition, GMM is also capable of generating multivariate analysis, which is suitable for our problem statement, which we intend to consider 7 parameters to make the final prediction on the medal winners, therefore, GMM model would fulfill our demand due to its ability of handling multivariate analysis. Moreover, we are trying to make a prediction, and the principle of GMM states that ultimately GMM model could provide probabilistic cluster memberships that indicate the athelete's likelihood of belonging to high performance group which means potential medal winners. In addition, instead of only implementing unsupervised machine learning algorithm which is GMM model in this case, we want to make more direct prediction instead of merely providing insights, hence, it is necessary to also integrate supervised machine learning algorithms into our proposed solution, we decided to implement logistic regression as the supervised machine learning algorithms to make the direct prediction based on the clusters that were indicated by prior GMM model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we chose logistic regression is the result that it generates is a binary result, which would give us the direct prediction of what charateristics that individual athelete possesses would make him/her a medal winner, which corresponds to our problem statement of predicting the future medal winners. It is also important to test our models to ensure they fit the dataset and they are accurate. For GMM model, since it is a unsupervised machine learning algorithm, we decided to implement log-likelihood function since it reflects how well the GMM model fits the distribution of the data; and for logistic regression, we decided to implement F1 score and confusion matrix, since the F1 socre balances the precision and recall which are both important to consider in our problem, and confusion matrix provides a comprehensive analysis of the model performance which is essential in improving our model."

    "As what we mentioned in the previous sections, we wanted to implement separate evaluation metrics for supervised and unsupervised algorithms. For unsupervised algorithm -- GMM model, we decided to implement log likelihood function to evaluate its performance. Since log likelihood function could provide the information of overall fit regarding the GMM model on our dataset, the higher log likelihood indicates a better fit. However, one drawback on this method is the computational cost might be high, since we need to sum the log probabilities of all the data in the dataset. So we might consider using regularization criteria in order to reduce the computational cost by reducing the complexity of the model.\n",

    "For supervised algorithm -- logistic regression, we decided to implement F1 score and confusion matrix on the model. The reason for utilizing F1 score is high recall score, which is the model corretly identifying most of the medal winners, while including some false positive results; and high precision score, which is when the model predicts an athelete to be the medal winner, it is most likely to be correct, while missing some actual winners are both desirable and important to our model, and F1 score balances between these two metrics and provide a more detailed result. The reason for using confusion matrix is it includes TP, TN, FP, FN, which would provide a comprehensive evaluation regarding the prediction results of our model which is essential for improving our model later on. Moreover, since logistic regression is a binary model, and confusion matrix is ideal for accessing binary model which is suitable in this case."
